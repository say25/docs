# Bash / Global

Bash setup and scripts I've written to re-use.

## Windows Setup

1. Add `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` to `~`
1. Create a `~\bin` folder and add functions there.

## Functions

| ---  | ---         |
| dotnet-sln-folder-add | Adds a project (.csproj) to all solutions (.sln) in current directory. |
| git-chmod | Grants execute in git to all files with specified extension. |
| git-reset-file | A script that resets a file to the what it is on master. |
